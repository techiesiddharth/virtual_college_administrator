# virtual_college_administrator
In these COVID times, when itâ€™s not easy to get out of home, it has become really hard for students to get in contact with the college administration possibly because of admin not being there or cause of long call queues, it has become of the utmost importance to automate the admin department to avoid the delay in answering the queries of students. 
Therefore, to solve this problem, an administration chatbot system is an efficient and convenient way to help the students and at the same time reduce the load on the administration department as basic queries can be catered to by the chatbot. The system would provide a login for the enrolled students and the admin, a separate login for the guests that provides information privy to outsiders. Users would be allowed to ask questions and the chatbot would find the keywords from that question and return the necessary answer. The admin is allowed to update existing keywords and answers or add new keywords and answers. The admin also has permissions to update the students list i.e. add a new student or delete an existing student or update details of an existing student.
